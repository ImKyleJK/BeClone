API v1
======

The Puppeteer API uses :abbr:`REST (Representational State Transfer)`.
JSON is returned by all API responses including errors
and HTTP response status codes are to designate success and failure.

.. warning::

    API v1 is planned to be deprecated soon, though we have not yet set a time
    frame for deprecation yet. We will alert users with our plans when we do.

    For now, API v1 is still used by some legacy application operations still,
    but we highly recommend PuppeteerAPI users use :doc:`API v2</api/v2>`
    instead.

    * Token based authentication
    * Easier to use URLs which no longer use numerical ids
    * More common user actions are exposed through the API
    * Improved error reporting

    See its full documentation at :doc:`/api/v2`.
